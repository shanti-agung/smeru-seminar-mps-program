## Low Learning Level in Developing Countries

- Simply increasing school inputs has a limited impact on improving students' learning [^1]
- Education in developing countries
    -   Runs on distorted systems [^2]
    -   Is a low accountability context [^3]

## Low Learning Level in Developing Countries (cont')

-   Recent efforts focus on processes
    -   Increase accountability [^4]
-   However, establishing an accountability system that works remains a challenge due to the complexity of unintended behavioral responses [^5]

## Beliefs, Behavioral Responses, and Schooling Outcomes

- Beliefs elicit behavioral responses ^[Benabou, 2015; Benabou and Tirole, 2016] 

- Studies on education in developing countries that examined the effect of beliefs on schooling outcomes concentrated on investigating students' and parents' beliefs ^[Nguyen, 2008; Jensen, 2010; Andrabi et al., 2017]

## Beliefs, Behavioral Responses, and Schooling Outcomes (cont')

- The possibility that teachers' beliefs influence their behavior is important to consider
- Teacher effort is among the binding constraints in translating education spending to students' learning ^[Glewwe and Muralidharan, 2015]
