## Low Learning Level in Developing Countries

-   Simply increasing school inputs has a limited impact on improving students' learning [^1]
-   Education in developing countries
    -   Runs on distorted systems [^2]
    -   Is a low accountability context [^3]

[^1]: Glewwe et al., 2004; Glewwe et al., 2009; Banerjee et al, 2005; Borkum et al., 2013; Pradhan et al., 2014; Das et al. 2013; de Ree et al., 2017

## Low Learning Level in Developing Countries (cont')

-   Recent efforts focus on processes
    -   Increase accountability [^4]
-   However, establishing an accountability system that works remains a challenge due to the complexity of unintended behavioral responses [^5]

[^4]: de Lan, 2008; Banerjee et al., 2009; Muralidharan and Sundararaman, 2011; Duflo et al., 2012; Pradhan et al., 2014; Loyalka et al., 2016; Andrabi et al., 2017

[^5]: Chen et al., 2001; Glewwe et al, 2008; Duflo et al., 2012

## Beliefs, Behavioral Responses, and Schooling Outcomes

-   Beliefs elicit behavioral responses [^6]

-   Studies on education in developing countries that examined the effect of beliefs on schooling outcomes concentrated on investigating students' and parents' beliefs [^7]

[^6]: Benabou, 2015; Benabou and Tirole, 2016

[^7]: Nguyen, 2008; Jensen, 2010; Andrabi et al., 2017

## Beliefs, Behavioral Responses, and Schooling Outcomes (cont')

-   The possibility that teachers' beliefs influence their behavior is important to consider
-   Teacher effort is among the binding constraints in translating education spending to students' learning [^8]

[^8]: Glewwe and Muralidharan, 2015

## Research Question

> [Do teachers' beliefs affect their accountability and, thus, students' learning in developing countries?]{style="font-size:80px;"}

## Identity as Beliefs

> An identity is a definition, an interpretation, of the self... People who have problems with identity are generally struggling with the difficult aspects of defining the self, such as establishing long term goals, major affiliations, and basic values [^9]

[^9]: Baumeister, 1986 cf. Benabou and Tirole, 2011

Identity influences behavior and can account for many problems not well explained by earlier economic approaches [^10]

[^10]: Akelrof and Kranton, 2000; Akelrof and Kranton, 2002

## Benabou and Tirole (2011)

-   Model identity as beliefs and emphasize self-inference process
-   Demand for beliefs
    -   Affective benefits
    -   Functional/ instrumental roles
-   When identity serves a commitment purpose, the ability to shape beliefs through actions can increase well-being

## Identity and Accountability

-   As Benabou and Tirole (2011) pointed out, the self-inference process and identity investment imply that accountability has an internal element (i.e., accountability to oneself)

-   Therefore, intervention in a teacher's identity could be a means of improving accountability

    -   Masyarakat Pendidikan Sejati (MPS) runs "Transformation Program: A Virtue and Character Strength Driven Approach"

## MPS Transformation Program

> Transformation Program: A Virtue and Character Strength Driven Approach

-   Yayasan Sasana Daya Cipta developed the program in partnership with Technology Research Center at Institut Teknologi Bandung

-   Initiated in 1993 in Bandung, it aims to improve education in Indonesia, focusing on school principals and teachers

## MPS Transformation Program (cont')

-   In the 1990s, teachers were economically and socially marginalized

-   Post-reformation in the 2000s, education spending was increasing, but little improvement

-   MPS principle:

> No quality education without quality teachers and school principals

## Five Domains of Intervention

The Transformation Program comprises five interconnected domains:

![](images/mps_five_domains.png){.absolute left="200" width="632"}

## Mindset

Implemented as "Transformational Leadership for Educators" training, it invites reframing the mindset on success, humanity, life purpose, education and its goals, teaching, and students

\

> Teachers and school principals as leaders of transformation who sow and cultivate virtue

## Aspiration

> Aspiration is a strong desire for a better future, as in vision, goals, or strategic intent

\
Aspiration leads the transformation toward a better future

-   A better person
-   A better teacher or school pricipal
-   A better school

## Strategy

> Strategy is guidelines of actions to achieve aspirations

-   *"Berkembang Dihela Kekuatan"*
    -   Strength driven development
-   **3S**: *"Mulai dari **S**aya (diri sendiri), **S**ekarang, **S**ekecil apapun"*
    -   Changes that begin with oneself
    -   Take actions now
    -   Actions for change are never too small to matter

## Strategy (cont')

-   **4M-3B**: *"**M**udah, **M**urah, **M**enggembirakan, **M**elibatkan -- **B**erguna, **B**ermakna, **B**erkelanjutan"*
    -   Implement improvements that are easy to implement, low cost, enjoyable, and encourage community participation
    -   Implement improvements that are useful, meaningful, and sustainable

## Strategy (cont')

-   **3N**: *"**N**iteni (mengamati), **N**iroke (meniru), **N**ambahi (menambah)"*
    -   Advice from [Ki Hajar Dewantara](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ki_Hajar_Dewantara): observe, adopt, and modify
-   **3 SA**: *"**S**ilih **A**sah (saling belajar), **S**ilih **A**sih (saling mempedulikan), **S**ilih **A**suh (saling mendukung)"*
    -   Mutual learning, mutual caring, and mutual support

## Systems

> Systems are mechanisms and forums that promote the learning and innovation process, spirits of continued improvement and growing together, and sustainability

## Knowledge and Skills

> Teachers and school principals are encouraged to develop knowledge and skills to fulfill their roles as leaders and change (transformation) agents

-   **Basic skills**: creativity for improving education quality

-   **Specific skills**: skill based on specific teaching assignments or themes, such as science and mathematics
